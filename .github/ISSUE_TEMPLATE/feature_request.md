<!--
Every bit of code requires people to maintain it.

We view scikit-optimize as mature, stable, and feature-complete. 
Thus, we don't envision vastly expanded scope or extra functionality.

Please follow this checklist before asking for a new feature:
* is the proposed feature in scope and tightly related to sequential
  model-based optimization of expensive black-box functions,
* no better Python alternatives exist.
